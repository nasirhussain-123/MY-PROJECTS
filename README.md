This is my first project in web development which is my portfolio website. For this project, I used HTML and CSS to learn the basic structure or layout of the HTML 
and the basic styling of the CSS. This was an exciting journey for me. This helps me to understand the basic layout
of a website. In the future, I will upgrade this project in terms of SEO, responsiveness, and many more.
